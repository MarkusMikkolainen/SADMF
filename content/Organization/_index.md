## Organizational Command Structure

### Coder

This role is the backbone of a SAD implementation. The job of the Coder is to transform requirements into machine executable instructions quickly and quietly. Coder expertise can be judged by the number of questions. Since a Coder is expected to be an expert at data structures and algorithms, fewer questions indicate more expertise.

### Quality Authority

Verifying quality is a specialist field that no *[**Coder**](#coder)* is qualified to perform. In addition, performing testing impedes the ability of the *[**Coder**](#coder)* to do their only job, type code. The Quality Authority team is the final arbiter of what the requirements mean and will create, maintain, and manually execute test scripts based on their understanding of the requirements. The end-user uses the system manually, so that is the only TRUE way to test it!

### DevOps Usage & Compliance Head Engineer

If the *Right Way* to do DevOps is not owned and controlled by a single senior manager, nobody will do it. So, we need a named person to codify the *Right Way* in the DevOps Process Binder and hold all teams accountable to the DevOps Process Excellence assessment. By staffing this role we prevent process drift and eventual mutation of the *Right Way*.

### Feature Team

The Feature Team is the group of Coders assembled to build a new feature for the next Convoy. Because we work so diligently to *[**Build Quality In**](/principles/#build-quality-in)* with the *[**Tribunal**](/release-convoy/#tribunal)*, these teams should be able to deliver at maximum throughput as soon as they are formed.

### Source Management Team

To improve *[**Coder**](#coder)* productivity by reducing the work required for integrating changes, we introduce the Source Management Team. The SMT is responsible for authorizing new *[**feature branches**](/practices/#fractal-based-development)*, creating the branches, and merging the complete branches from each *[**Coder**](#coder)* into the Conflict Arbitration branch. They will then resolve all conflicts for the Coders before alerting the *[**Quality Authority**](#quality-authority)* that the Convoy is ready for testing.

### Code Standards Enforcement Team

Coders are too close to the problem to effectively review code for their Feature Team. Additionally, reviewing code takes time away from coding. To resolve this, the CSET is formed to perform all code reviews. The CSET is also responsible for defining and enforcing all coding standards for the enterprise. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Indentation depth
* Using tabs vs. spaces
* Use of approved *[**EARB**](#enterprise-architecture-review-board)* variable and method names
* Comment format

### Enterprise Architecture Review Board

The EARB is responsible for maintaining the Book of Names. This master list defines all acceptable words and word combinations that may be used for naming things during coding. This ensures that Coders will not be confused when they join a new Feature Team for the next Convoy. The EARB will meet every 6 weeks to review and reject any new words submitted for inclusion.
