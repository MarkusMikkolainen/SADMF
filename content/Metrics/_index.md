## Lines of code per Coder

 We need to ensure our Coders are focused on the feature for the next convoy. The fleet won't wait! We also need to ensure we have balanced metrics to prevent a perverse incentive when we track who created defects. If we only track defects, the *[**Coder**](/organization/#coder)* may try to assume the role of Unit Tester. That wastes time. Therefore, we need to measure the lines of code produced by each *[**Coder**](/organization/#coder)*.

## Number of code review comments per convoy

Code review is important to make sure code is formatted correctly. We measure the number of review comments to make sure each *[**Coder**](/organization/#coder)* is being critical enough of the work of others.

## Tasks delivered per Coder

For each *[**Coder**](/organization/#coder)*, the number of tasks they complete during Convoy. By tracking the number of features each *[**Coder**](/organization/#coder)* completes, more can be shipped in each Convoy. Volume is important. Let's turn it up to 11!

## Defects created by Coder

For each *[**Coder**](/organization/#coder)*, we should track the number of defects they create and use this information to inform the *[**Tribunal**](/release-convoy/#tribunal)*. We must *[**Build Quality In**](/principles/#build-quality-in)* by eliminating the source of defects.

## Defects detected by Testers

For each Tester, we should track the number of defects they detect and use this information to inform the *[**Tribunal**](/release-convoy/#tribunal)*. We must *[**Build Quality In**](/principles/#build-quality-in)* by eliminating Testers that cannot find defects.

## SADMF Maturity Score

The precise execution of the SAD Delivery Lifecycle is critical to the success of SADMF. Without "excellent" maturity scores, your customers will have no confidence you used approved SADMF processes to deliver!

## Features Completed vs. Committed

The features delivered in the Convoy compared to what was planned 8 quarters ago.

## SADMF Adoption Rate

This is the percentage of the organization that is Certified SAD&trade;.
