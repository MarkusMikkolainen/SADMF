A Convoy doesn't navigate by dead reckoning. We require proper documentation to keep from leaving any Release Captain behind!

#### Priority Change Request

A Priority Change Request must be created and approved during the [Captain's Mast](/release-convoy/#captains-mast) before changing the priority of any feature. This request must contain the following critical information:

* Feature name
* [Feature Captain's](/organization/#feature-captain-fc) name
* Priority ID
* New proposed Priority ID
* [Feature Team](/organization/#feature-team-ft) size
* [CSET](/organization/#code-standards-enforcement-team-cset) approvals
* [EARB](/organization/#enterprise-architecture-review-board-earb) approvals
* Approvals from all [Feature Captains](/organization/#feature-captain-fc) in the Convoy
* [Commodore's](/organization/#commodore-c) approval
