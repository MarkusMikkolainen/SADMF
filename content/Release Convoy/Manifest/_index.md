A Convoy doesn't navigate by dead reckoning. We require proper documentation to keep from leaving any Release Captain behind!

#### Priority Change Request

A Priority Change Request must be created and approved during the *[**Captain's Mast**](/release-convoy/#captains-mast)* before changing the priority of any feature. This request must contain the following critical information:

* Feature name
* Feature Captain's name
* Priority ID
* New proposed Priority ID
* *[**Feature Team**](/organization/#feature-team)* size
* *[**CSET**](/organization/#code-standards-enforcement-team)* approvals
* *[**EARB**](/organization/#enterprise-architecture-review-board)* approvals
* Approvals from all Feature Captains in the Convoy
* Commodore's approval
