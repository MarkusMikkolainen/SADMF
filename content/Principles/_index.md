## Build Quality In

Quality software comes from quality people. Therefore, Poor quality software must come from poor quality people. To **build quality in**, we remove the things that reduce quality.

## Work in Small Batches

Too many releases are hard to report and manage. To reduce the number of updates to the [Release Tracking](/practices/#release-tracking) spreadsheet, we should focus on a small number of releases each quarter. This provides us with more time to [Amplify Feedback](#amplify-feedback).

## Amplify Feedback

Coaching employees is an important daily practice to ensure they know we are tracking their work and care about their output.

## Everyone is Responsible

Each [Code Engineer](/organization/#code-engineer-ce) is responsible for their own work and should be rewarded for the work they do. If a feature is successfully delivered, we should identify the [Code Engineer](/organization/#code-engineer-ce) who made the most changes and give them a bonus. It would be unfair to reward the whole team based on the excellence of an individual.

## Psychological Safety

We know the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/#tribunal) can be a stressful time. When we need to remove Code Engineers, we will use "Human Resources as a Service" where individual performance data is used to automatically help [Code Engineers](/organization/#code-engineer-ce) find new opportunities outside our company. This allows us to avoid confrontation.

## Systems Thinking

The Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework is built upon systems thinking. There are two systems that operate within the SADMF System. The [System of Authority (SOA)*](/organization/#system-of-authority-soa) (SOA) and the [System of Service (SOS)*](/organization/#system-of-service-sos) (SOS). Both Systems are accountable to the [Admiral's Transformation Office (ATO)*](/organization/#admirals-transformation-office-ato).
