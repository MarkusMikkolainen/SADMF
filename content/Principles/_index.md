#### Build Quality In

Quality software comes from quality people. Poor quality software must therefore come from poor quality people. To improve the quality of our software, we remove the things that reduce quality.

#### Work in Small Batches

Too many releases are hard to report and manage. To reduce the number of updates to the release tracking spreadsheet, we should focus on a small number of releases each quarter. This provides us with more time to *[**Amplify Feedback**](#amplify-feedback)*.

#### Amplify Feedback

Coaching employees is an important daily practice to ensure they know we are tracking their work and care about their output.

#### Everyone is Responsible

Each [Coder](../organization/#coder) is responsible for their own work and should be rewarded for the work they do. If a feature is successfully delivered, we should identify the [Coder](../organization/#coder) who made the most changes and give them a bonus. It would be unfair to reward the whole team based on the excellence of an individual.

#### Psychological Safety

We know the *[**Tribunal**](../release-convoy/#tribunal)* can be a stressful time. When we need to remove Coders, we will use "Human Resources as a Service" where individual performance data is used to automatically help Coders find new opportunities outside our company. This allows us to avoid confrontation.

#### Systems Thinking

The Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework is built upon systems thinking. There are two systems that operate within the SADMF System. The *[**System of Authority**](#system-of-authority)* (SOA) and the *[**System of Service**](#system-of-service)* (SOS). Both Systems are accountable to the Admiral's Transformation Office (ATO).

- **Admirals Transformation Office (ATO)**: This is the heartbeat of the transformation, it is the command-and-control center to ensure everyone is achieving the goals of SADMF. It is accountable for the 5-8 transformation roadmap, assessments, metrics, certification renewals, and general project management of the transformation. The ATO is led by the Admiral, who commands all direction, innovation, and methodology implemented at scale.
- **System of Authority (SOA)**: This is the team of teams accountable for implanting SADMF in your organization. The SOA is staffed by contractors and consultants with diverse points of view. These principled practitioners will focus on implementing the orders of the ATO and will focus on updating plans, collecting metrics, assessing, and becoming trusted advisors for the teams so they can report the ground-level truth to leadership during the tribunal.
- **System of Service (SOS)**: This is the team of teams accountable for achieving deadlines and shipping code. The SOS will look to the chain of command for servant leadership to ensure self-governance and instruct the Feature Teams on their day-to-day work. The SOS is empowered to predictably deliver on time and on budget.
